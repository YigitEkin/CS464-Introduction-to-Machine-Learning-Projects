## Grades:
* Project 1: 90/100
* Project 2: 85/100
## Project 1: PCA and Logistic Regression

In the first part of this project, PCA is applied on images for dimensionality reduction and they are reconstructed back. In the second part, a logistic regression model is trained on a CSV file to determine whether a plane is harmful or not.

## Project 2: CNN, FCN and Resnet with Pytorch

In this project, a [Kaggle dataset of weather images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pratik2901/multiclass-weather-dataset) is used and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Fully Connected Networks (FCNs), and ResNet transfer learning is applied to classify the images.
